<h2> About The Project </h2><br/>
<p> This is a sample application that demonstrates an Travel website. The application loads a set of ticket bookings and travel blogs. Users can book flight tickets ot take   car for rentals or book hotels. This application also includes a travel blog. This website displays a home page, about us page, services page, login page and a feedback page to make it more efficient. I have made the website with html and css with simple codes which enables easy understanding and accessibility.</p></br>
  <p>The website link is: <a href="https://madan-2004.github.io/Travel-Website/">www.Travelster.com</a></p>
